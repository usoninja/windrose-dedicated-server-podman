## Quick diagnostics

Use these commands for a fast operational check:

```bash
# 1) Basic container and health status
./windrose status

# 2) Full host/runtime preflight
./windrose doctor

# 3) World integrity check (orphan/broken entries)
./windrose worlds-check

# 4) Recent critical network/auth errors from current log file
podman compose logs --no-color --tail 400 windrose | grep -Ei "account verification failed|turn session was expired|p2pgate disconnected|server authorization failed|login finished with error"

# 5) Create diagnostics bundle for incident review
./windrose diagnostics
```

If command `3` returns lines repeatedly, check outbound connectivity and firewall/NAT behavior for `*.windrose.support` on UDP/TCP `3478`.

For a machine-readable snapshot, use `./windrose status-json`.

For quick player activity extraction from logs, use `./windrose activity history [lines]`.

For structured join/leave records, use `./windrose activity events [lines]`.
Events are appended as JSON lines to `./logs/player-events.log`.
The parser is best-effort and now prefers richer Windrose/UE markers such as `Login request`, prelogin/account verification, and account summary dumps when they are present.
Entries may also include an optional `name` field when the server log exposes a human-readable player name.
A persistent identity map is maintained in `./state/player-identities.tsv` and reused to improve name resolution for disconnect events.

Legacy aliases are still supported for backward compatibility: `./windrose player-history`, `./windrose player-events`.

## Client cannot connect (quick checklist)

Use this first-line checklist before deeper debugging:

1. Restart the game client and Steam.
2. Restart the router and the client PC.
3. Disable VPN/proxy on the client.
4. Temporarily disable aggressive antivirus/firewall filtering.
5. Retry joining 3-5 times.

If the issue persists only on selected networks, continue with DNS and ISP checks below.

---

## DNS check for game services

Run these commands on the affected client machine:

```bash
nslookup r5coopapigateway-eu-release.windrose.support
nslookup r5coopapigateway-eu-release.windrose.support 8.8.8.8
```

How to interpret results:

- Expected: a normal IPv4 address is returned.
- `Non-existent domain`: local DNS/ISP may be filtering the domain.
- `Request timed out`: DNS resolver or local security tooling may be blocking requests.
- `127.0.0.1`: local override, VPN, or ISP spoofing is likely.
- IPv6-only answer: prefer IPv4 for this game flow.

---

## ISP/network block playbook (3478 UDP/TCP)

If failures repeat on one ISP/network, ask for a whitelist check with this template:

- Domains: `*.windrose.support`
- Port: `3478`
- Protocols: `UDP`, `TCP`
- Traffic type: `STUN/TURN` (NAT traversal)
- Purpose: legitimate game connectivity

Also test from a different network (for example mobile hotspot) to confirm whether the issue is network-specific.

## World ID mismatch — server generates new world on startup

If the server generates a fresh, empty world on every startup instead of loading your existing world, the most common cause is a mismatch between three critical values.

### How the server decides which world to load

When the dedicated server starts, it compares:

1. **WorldIslandId** in `data/R5/ServerDescription.json`
2. **Folder name** on disk under `.../Worlds/<folder_name>`
3. **islandId** field inside `WorldDescription.json` (within that folder)

If all three values match exactly, the server loads the existing world.
If any one mismatches, the server assumes this is a fresh install and generates a new world, overwriting the `WorldIslandId` in `ServerDescription.json`.

### Diagnostic steps

1. **Stop the server first** — do not edit config on a running server:

   ```bash
   ./windrose stop
   ```

2. **Check the current WorldIslandId**:

   ```bash
   cat data/R5/ServerDescription.json | grep -i WorldIslandId
   ```

3. **List existing world folders**:

   ```bash
   ls -la data/R5/Saved/SaveProfiles/Default/RocksDB_v2/*/Worlds/ 2>/dev/null || ls -la data/R5/Saved/SaveProfiles/Default/RocksDB/*/Worlds/
   ```

   Note the folder names — these are world IDs.

4. **For each world folder, check its islandId**:

   ```bash
   cat data/R5/Saved/SaveProfiles/Default/RocksDB_v2/<version>/Worlds/<WorldID>/WorldDescription.json | grep -i islandId
   # or for RocksDB (old layout):
   cat data/R5/Saved/SaveProfiles/Default/RocksDB/<version>/Worlds/<WorldID>/WorldDescription.json | grep -i islandId
   ```

5. **Compare all three values**:
   - Does `ServerDescription.json WorldIslandId` match the folder name?
   - Does the folder name match the `islandId` in `WorldDescription.json`?
   - Are all three identical?

### Fix — align the three values

If they don't match:

1. Choose the **correct world ID** (the one with your save data).
2. Update `ServerDescription.json` to use that ID:

   ```bash
   cat data/R5/ServerDescription.json | sed 's/"WorldIslandId": "[^"]*"/"WorldIslandId": "<correct_id>"/' > temp.json && mv temp.json data/R5/ServerDescription.json
   ```

   Or edit manually with a text editor.

3. If the folder name doesn't match the ID:

   ```bash
   mv data/R5/Saved/SaveProfiles/Default/RocksDB_v2/<version>/Worlds/<old_name> data/R5/Saved/SaveProfiles/Default/RocksDB_v2/<version>/Worlds/<correct_id>
   ```

4. Start the server and verify:
   ```bash
   ./windrose start
   ./windrose logs | grep -i "loading world"
   ```

### When the IDs match but new worlds still appear

If all three values are correct but the server still generates a new world on startup, the save data itself may be corrupted. In that case:

- See [Recover corrupted saves (manual restoration)](https://windrose.support/faq/recover-corrupted-saves-manual-restoration) for the official upstream recovery guide
- Or try restoring from a recent backup inside `RocksDB_v2_Backups` (see AutoLoadLatestBackupIfHasBroken in README.md)

## LAN clients fail, WAN clients work

If the server runs in Docker bridge mode on Linux and LAN clients are dropped after about 10 seconds, this is an ICE/STUN consent failure caused by Docker's MASQUERADE NAT rule rewriting the source IP on LAN-bound packets.

Typical symptoms:

- WAN clients connect, LAN clients fail after ~10 seconds
- Server logs contain: `Check consent was failed for IceControlling. Reach timeout 10000 ms`

### Fix — Part 1: bypass MASQUERADE on the Docker host

1. Find the container's internal IP:

   ```bash
   docker inspect windrose | grep '"IPAddress"'
   ```

2. Add a NAT bypass rule scoped to this container and your LAN subnet:

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -s <container_ip>/32 -d <lan_subnet>/24 -j RETURN
   # Example:
   sudo iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -s 172.17.0.2/32 -d 192.168.1.0/24 -j RETURN
   ```

   Using `/32` scopes the rule to only this container; other containers are unaffected.

3. Persist the rule across reboots:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y iptables-persistent
   sudo netfilter-persistent save
   ```

> ⚠ **Caveat:** Container IP can change when the container is recreated. After `podman compose up`, verify the IP with `podman inspect` and update the iptables rule if needed.

### Fix — Part 2: add a route on the LAN client

The client must be able to route replies back to the container subnet.

**Windows** (elevated CMD or PowerShell):

```cmd
route add 172.17.0.0 MASK 255.255.0.0 <server_host_lan_ip> -p
```

**Linux**:

```bash
sudo ip route add 172.17.0.0/16 via <server_host_lan_ip>
```

**macOS**:

```bash
sudo route add -net 172.17.0.0/16 <server_host_lan_ip>
```

### Verify

After applying both parts, check server logs for successful ICE consent:

```bash
podman compose logs windrose | grep -i "Nominated\|Consented\|Succeeded"
```

Expected: `Nominated pair Succeeded` and `CheckConsent ... Consented pair ... Succeeded`.

> **Note:** For this repository's default (`network_mode: host`), Docker bridge NAT is bypassed entirely and this fix is not needed.

## Wine prefix fails in restricted environments (seccomp)

### Symptoms

- `wineboot` completes in 0s instead of the expected 20–60s
- Container log contains: `wine: socket : Function not implemented`
- Wine diagnostics show `kernel32.dll present=no`
- Startup exits with `Wine prefix initialization failed after 2 attempts`

### Cause

The host kernel or seccomp profile is blocking the `AF_ALG` socket family (family 38).
Wine calls `socket(AF_ALG, ...)` during early initialization; if the syscall is blocked,
`wineboot` exits immediately without writing the prefix.

Common environments where this occurs:

- Proxmox LXC containers (unprivileged, with default seccomp)
- Any Docker host with a custom or strict seccomp profile that does not permit `AF_ALG`

### Fix 1 — temporary: disable seccomp for the container

In `docker-compose.yml`, under the `windrose` service, add:

```yaml
security_opt:
	- seccomp:unconfined
```

Restart the container. This disables all seccomp filtering for the container.
Use only in trusted environments where you accept the reduced kernel syscall isolation.

### Fix 2 — targeted: custom seccomp profile allowing AF_ALG

Create a custom seccomp profile that extends Docker's default and permits `socket` for address family 38 (`AF_ALG`).
See [Docker seccomp documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/) for how to build and reference a custom profile.

In `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
security_opt:
	- seccomp:/path/to/custom-seccomp.json
```

This is the preferred fix for production environments.

### Fix 3 — Proxmox LXC

Unprivileged LXC containers in Proxmox apply an additional seccomp layer that cannot be overridden from Docker alone.

Options in order of preference:

1. Convert the LXC container to **privileged** (Proxmox UI → Options → Unprivileged container → disable). Restart the CT after the change.
2. Run the server in a **Proxmox VM** instead of an LXC container. VMs run a full kernel without LXC seccomp restrictions.

> Privileged LXC containers have weaker isolation. Prefer a dedicated VM for production use.

## Choosing the right image

- Try `staging` when stable Wine builds fail on a specific host with prefix or runtime compatibility issues.
- Try `debug` when you need extra tools and more verbose logging to investigate Wine, DNS, or network problems.
- Use `staging` only as a fallback for Wine compatibility issues on a specific host.
- Use `debug` when you need extra troubleshooting tools inside the image.
